## Our Principles
**At the core of DIY, is a belief that creativity and knowledge should be open and free**. We believe that the projects and inventions that are shared on DIY should be distributed and licensed in such a way that both protects the rights and privacy of the individual creator and ultimately contributes the most value to the larger community. Because of this, any and all works of authorship copyrightable by you and posted by you to DIY are submitted under the terms of a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Furthermore, these Terms of Service are available on [Github](https://github.com/diy/tos) under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) where we fully encourage anyone from the community to use, fork, submit pull requests, and share feedback with us.

C.	Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:

If the Content provider, member or user believes that the Content that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the Content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such Content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

1.  A physical or electronic signature of the Content provider, member or user;
2.  Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
3.  A statement that the Content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and
4.  Content provider’s, member’s or user’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located, or if the Content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which DIY is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, DIY’s may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.  Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at DIY’s discretion.
